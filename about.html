            This was an expeirimental website created by Peppers (Dylan Miguel) as part of a community service project for his school. The acutal project is an "Anti-Smoking" website which will start working on shortly. (Though I'm not actually sure when "shortly" would be.) This website was created to test out a responsive layout so that the website could fit on all screen resoulutions. Responsive designs is one of the hardest things to do when coding in css and html. Luckly I was able to find a few videos talking about the subject, and I went from there. So from now on this would be my personal website. By the way this is all coded with pure html and css.

In recent news we have started development of the Stop Smoking Get Help website, our real community service project. I am hoping to get done by the end of Febuary 2018 and live by the beggining of March. I hope to see some of you guys there. Also this will now be used as a news box, so keep a lookout for some important news, I will be blogging my progress, along the way. Right now I have finished some ideas to use for the website. Until then I'll see you guys later.

            <p>Dylan Miguel a web designer and script kiddie, but I know enough of HTML and CSS to atleast know what the heck I am doing. I live in (censored) and I am (censored) years old. I hope to improve upon my coding skills by the end of the 2018 year. Maybe one day. </p>
